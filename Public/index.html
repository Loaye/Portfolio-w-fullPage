            <p>I am a recently seperated Combat Veteran looking for his place in the work force. My hobbies range from hiking, photography, working out, to creating full stacked applications. I grew up loving puzzles and game that revolved aroud using my brain to solve solutions. I only ever needed myself for these puzzles, until I joined the Army. The Army is where I learned that you can't do everything by yourself. I was able to take it to the next level and apply it. This application drove me to be better a better person, not just for myself, but for my friends. For any situation that may arise, was able to be tackled through growth and new experiences. Leveraging friends and myself, to pairing strengths and weaknesses always led to completion of any task. This left me wanting more to which eventually led to selection and becoming a Ranger. I see all of this in the world of code. </p>

            <h2>Projects Overview</h2>
            <p>A few projects that I have worked on while attending a 201 Beginner Level Course at Code Academy. These projects range from working as indivual to working with groups of 2-5 classmates. I am proud of every project. Each project had its own speedbumps, struggles, and time ranging of 5 mins to 5 hours of banging our heads on the table.</p>

            <h3>What I learned..?</h3>
            <p>With my transition, I am trying to find my place. A role, in society if you will. Being in the school has really helped me. I always thought I was going to be different and not be able to interact with anyone due to my experience in the military. I learned that people are pretty much the same as they are in the military, I just have to adjust my how I interact. In a summarized pair of words, Self Awareness. Since attending this course, it has forced me to work with people of all walks of life. Being able to recognize these differences and still adjusting myself to be able to perform at an optimal level and to still get the task at hand done has tested myself as a leader and a team member.</p>

            <h3>Overall Take Away</h3>
            <p>We have only scratched the surface and it has been insane. The fact there is so much more to learn and is an everly changing field, give it the appeal I need. I honestly get bored easily, I love how we can do one task, fifty different ways. A life devoted to learning, I can't wait.</p>
